Various configuration files my linux set-ups. 

TODO
====

Modularise this puppy so that my main config sits in the master branch, then submodules load in for specific machine additions (or something like that).

- [X] Most of .bash_profile is for Soma only - move into local module
- [X] Move dvorak keybindings to submodule or check if keymap is dvorak before applying them
- [ ] Fenchurch's dir_colours is massive compared to Soma's. Check if any of it is wanted before killing it off
- [ ] Really not a fan of the hybrid color scheme, molokai is nice, but too bright. Need a new one.
